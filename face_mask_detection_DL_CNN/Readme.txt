Face Mask Detection:
	- Used to predict the person is wearing mask or not

Dataset:
	- Images with mask and without mask

Algorithm:
	- Convolutional Neural Networks
	- Haarcascade frontal face detector is used for face detections and the colored face image is passed to convolutional neural networks.

Description:
	- While testing, the face should be in brighter.
